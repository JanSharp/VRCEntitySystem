- [x] Add entity instance pooling instead of instantiating and destroying every time
- [x] Add support for entity data existing without an entity existing yet
  - [x] Preferably add staggered entity instantiation, limited to x entities per frame
- [x] Add support for latency hidden entities (when creating, and when destroying them)
  - [ ] Test destroying entities
- [ ] Add dependency on player data, specifically to use persistent ids
- [x] ~~Desynced transform state should periodically fetch the current position and rotation and save that in the entity system's game state~~ nope, since exports can actually include non game state safe data there's no longer a need for this information
- [ ] exporting entities with desynced transforms should include their current transform values
- [x] non export serialization desynced entities should not include transform values
- [ ] add flag to mark an entity as static
- [ ] maybe change the no transform sync flag to a counter. Though when there are multiple systems trying to take control of syncing of an entity's transform, I don't foresee that going well currently so this is low priority if it even makes sense at all
- [x] no transform sync is annoying to use because of the transform values reset in the game state that happens when enabling it. The reset is required in order to have identical game states including for those who join late, however if a system using the no transform sync feature doesn't actually handle all 3 of the transform values, like not handling scale for example, the result is the scale in the game state differing from the real scale of the entity when no transform sync gets disabled again
- [x] ~~import of pre instantiated entities deleted them and created new ones, pretty sure, which it's not supposed to~~ incorrect observation
- [ ] consider raising the OnInstantiate event for pre instantiated entities on start rather than later. Now that every pre instantiated entity is going to get it raise eventually, it should be safe to do so sooner as well. Can also spread it out across frames if desired
- [ ] probably collapse the Prototype class into the EntityPrototype class
- [x] need game state safe events on EntityExtensionData for when they get created and deleted
- [x] raise an event on default entities to "initialize" them, similar to Start, except that order of operations is known and this initialize function actually calls OnInitialize by default
- [x] late joiner does not destroy entities. It would seem that destroying entities doesn't actually destroy them, more like hide them
- [ ] impl sleeping physics entities
- [ ] impl physics entities interpolation when receiving new data that doesn't match what it simulated locally
- [ ] consider using collision events to detect rigid bodies waking up
- [ ] gradual update loop for sleeping physics entities to make sure they didn't move without it being synced at some point
- [ ] use UpdateManager for EntityPooling
