- [x] Add entity instance pooling instead of instantiating and destroying every time
- [x] Add support for entity data existing without an entity existing yet
  - [x] Preferably add staggered entity instantiation, limited to x entities per frame
- [x] Add support for latency hidden entities (when creating, and when destroying them)
  - [ ] Test destroying entities
- [ ] Add dependency on player data, specifically to use persistent ids
- [x] ~~Desynced transform state should periodically fetch the current position and rotation and save that in the entity system's game state~~ nope, since exports can actually include non game state safe data there's no longer a need for this information
- [ ] exporting entities with desynced transforms should include their current transform values
- [x] non export serialization desynced entities should not include transform values
- [ ] add flag to mark an entity as static
- [x] ~~maybe change the no transform sync flag to a counter. Though when there are multiple systems trying to take control of syncing of an entity's transform, I don't foresee that going well currently so this is low priority if it even makes sense at all~~ there can only be EntityTransformController
- [x] no transform sync is annoying to use because of the transform values reset in the game state that happens when enabling it. The reset is required in order to have identical game states including for those who join late, however if a system using the no transform sync feature doesn't actually handle all 3 of the transform values, like not handling scale for example, the result is the scale in the game state differing from the real scale of the entity when no transform sync gets disabled again
- [x] ~~import of pre instantiated entities deleted them and created new ones, pretty sure, which it's not supposed to~~ incorrect observation
- [ ] consider raising the OnInstantiate event for pre instantiated entities on start rather than later. Now that every pre instantiated entity is going to get it raise eventually, it should be safe to do so sooner as well. Can also spread it out across frames if desired
- [x] probably collapse the Prototype class into the EntityPrototype class
- [x] need game state safe events on EntityExtensionData for when they get created and deleted
- [x] raise an event on default entities to "initialize" them, similar to Start, except that order of operations is known and this initialize function actually calls OnInitialize by default
- [x] late joiner does not destroy entities. It would seem that destroying entities doesn't actually destroy them, more like hide them
- [x] impl sleeping physics entities
- [x] impl physics entities interpolation when receiving new data that doesn't match what it simulated locally
- [x] sleeping rigidbodies get set to be kinematic, this deprecates these 2 TODOs, at least for the time being
  - [x] ~~consider using collision events to detect rigid bodies waking up~~
  - [x] ~~gradual update loop for sleeping physics entities to make sure they didn't move without it being synced at some point~~
- [x] use UpdateManager for EntityPooling
- [ ] make isKinematic its own thing for physics entities, rather than repurposing it for isSleeping. Entities which have a default of isKinematic do not mean that they are sleeping by default, it means that they are not affected by physics at all by default
- [ ] make the "NoPosition/Rotation/ScaleSync" api better. Just like make it better. Just do that. Not like you've spent 3 days thinking about it already and found nothing satisfying
- [x] probably make prototype id 1 be the first one, 0 be invalid
- [ ] make physics entities keep track of the amount of time passed in between rigid body update input actions in order to reduce the amount of times objects interpolate "back in time"
- [ ] custom inspector for entities which shows
  - [ ] the entity prototype definition, if it exists
  - [ ] the entity prototype, if present in the scene
  - [ ] a read only list of entity extensions
- [ ] maybe make pre instantiated entities export a flag indicating whether they've been moved from their original location to give the option to not import their locations. This enables moving pre instantiated entities in the scene and then importing old data while retaining the change in default location.
- [ ] the last user player id is not a properly and fully implemented system
- [ ] physics entities that are awake by default do not go to sleep when the rigid body stops moving, since the update loop does not start and there is no responsible player
- [ ] use the fact that entity prefabs are actually already instances in the scene, specifically by using te \[SingletonReference\] attribute for entities and entity extensions
- [ ] split the internal name of entities into 2 fields: namespace and internal name. Neither of those are allowed to contain a `.`, as they will get combined into one script like this: `namespace.internal-name`
- [x] make custom inspector for entities and physics entity extensions simply to remove the line that gets drawn by default by the UdonSharp inspector
- [x] maybe lower the max work ms per frame to like 5 instead of 20. It does get very noticeably frame-y while deserializing and if I had to guess people prefer having more comfortable frames while the system is loading rather than it loading a few seconds faster overall
